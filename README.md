## Why we have chosen github?

The reason why we have chosen github is not just because of how reputable it is. In fact, one of the main reasons why we have picked github is because of how easy it is for the public to contribute to our project. Github offers a wiki as well as a issues tracker that would make it easier for us to include a more indepth documentation and gather feedback for our project. Not only so, github is not just a website for documentations and instructions, however, a repository, which means that it would allow us to keep updating ,make changes or improve our project easily. Additionally, github is widely supported by numerous services and operating systems, demonstrating great versatility. 

## What have we uploaded?

We have uploaded all the source codes required for our project, as well as a clear and concise documentation on how our project functions as well as how any user can replicate our project if they intend to do so. A diagram on how a user should position their raspberry pis outside their house will also be provided if the user wishes to fully replicate our project.

## What is the application about?

Nowadays, there is a trend that most of us would invest in high-end sneakers or shoes. Because of their high prices, we would be afraid to leave them unguarded, therefore bring them into the house. However, it is a chore to clean the shoes so that we do not dirty our house each time we bring it in. As such, our application intends to solve this. Our application will provide a form of security for your shoes, as well as implement a gate security that is convenient for both guests and home owners.
